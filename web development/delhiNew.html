            <p class="sectionSubTag">The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was
                dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in
                the city. Like all Baháʼí Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or
                any other qualification. According to Shoghi Effendi, a Bahá'í temple is a “silent teacher” of the
                Bahá'í faith. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters
                of three to form nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly
                over 34 meters and a capacity of 2,500 people. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural
                awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles. A 2001 CNN report referred to
                it as the most visited building in the world

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Humayun's tomb (Hindustani: Maqbara-i Humayun, Persian: آرامگاه همایون‎) is the
                tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife
                and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum), in 1558, and
                designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her.
                It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi,
                India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun found in
                1533. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale. The tomb was
                declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration
                work, which is complete. Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot
                the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the
                main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher
                Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.

            <p class="sectionTag">INDIA GATE</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial
                located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly
                called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in
                between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa,
                Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300
                servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the
                gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch
                such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the
                Gateway of India in Mumbai.

                Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a
                reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the
                archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served
                as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India
                and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan
                Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. The memorial-gate is also a popular spot for
                protests by the civil society in New Delhi.
