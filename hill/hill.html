    <p>It would not be an understatement to say that the hill stations of India so enraptured the British that they sought to discover more and more of them and mint them after themselves. Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh, named after Lord Dalhousie, the then governor-general of India, or Horsely Hills Andhra Pradesh, which gets its name from the district collector of Cuddappah district, WD Horsely, are only two of the many hill stations that the British favoured in India. Even today, the hill stations of India remain stunningly beautiful destinations for globe-trotters. From the snow-capped Himalayas in Uttarakhand to the exotic hills of Darjeeling in the east, the Indian sub-continent has no dearth of delightful hilly towns that rarely fail to mesmerise a visitor.<br><br>

        A piece of paradise, Gulmarg, is the cherry on top. Known as a meadow of flowers ('Gul' means flower and 'marg' means pathway), it is a popular skiing destination, and its huge pine forests, steep slopes and valleys present a picturesque setting to visitors. Not just serene and calm, but hilly terrain in India has been developed so as to let one indulge in adrenaline-gushing activities as well. The hill station of Manali is one such beauty that is a hotspot for adventure sports like paragliding (Bir-Billing), while Auli, in Uttarakhand is a popular landing pad for winter adventure sports.The Valley of Gods, Kullu, is a dreamy place that is flooded by visitors and spiritual devotees alike. Another noteworthy destination is the Nandi hills in Karnataka from where one can get a glorious view of a sunrise. Lying in the lap of the Himalayas, the state of Uttarakhand boasts several mesmeric hill stations including Nainital, Kausani, Mussoorie and Almora. Moreover, pilgrimage destinations like the popular char dham - Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri â€“ invite travellers from far and wide.
        <br>
        The gentle slopes and pleasant climes of some of the hills in the country favour tea tourism, which is slowly catching pace among travellers. The verdant stretches of the hills of Darjeeling, also called the Queen of Hill Stations, boast tea gardens that are a sight to behold. Munnar in Kerala is rife with miles and miles of lush tea plantations that leave one in awe. Also known as Blue Mountains, Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu have acres of sprawling tea plantations that give a good produce throughout the year. Tour through these gardens and soak in the rich and aromas of various varieties like the Black tea and Oolong.
        <br>
        When it comes to ferocious grandeur and logic-defying natural phenomenon, Leh in  Jammu and Kashmir makes for an enthralling visit. Hosting the famous Magnetic Hill, where gravity takes a back seat and cars are pulled uphill, the place holds a particular charm for thrill-seekers.   </p>
