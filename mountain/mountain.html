    <p>The Indian peninsula is home to many majestic and mighty mountain peaks and ranges. The most prominent among these are the Great Himalayas that boast almost all the high peaks in the world. The Mount Everest is the highest point, reaching an elevation of almost 8,848 m. Leh-Ladakh lying in the northern part of the Great Himalayas is a surreal tourist destination, where one can visit to admire natural retreats, soak in serenity and spirituality, and indulge in adventure sports like trekking, mountain biking, mountain climbing etc. Moreover, the meadows of Tapovan in Uttarakhand provide enchanting views of the peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas. To explore the Kumaon Himalayas, head to Munsiyari, a tiny hill town, which makes an excellent vantage point to sight the spectacular Panchachuli group of peaks.<br>

        The Karakoram range borders India on the north-west and is home to the maximum glaciers on the planet, save the polar regions. The Siachen and the Biafo glaciers are also located in this range and are believed to be among the largest glaciers in the world. Starting from Himachal Pradesh and running into the state of Jammu and Kashmir is the stunning Pir Panjal range, also called the Lower Himalayas. This range encompasses valleys and hill stations like Gulmarg, which look like nothing less than paradise.<br>
        
        Along the eastern part of the country runs the Purvanchal Range, which covers most of the states of the Northeast. Even central India boasts verdant mountains and the popular Satpura and Vindhaya Range stand parallel to each other. Housing many beautiful hill stations, teeming national parks and spiritual sites, these ranges make for a great tourist getaway.<br>
        
        One of the oldest mountain ranges in the country and the world is the Aravalli Range, which is spread across areas of Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi and Gujarat. These mountains stand as a buffer for the monsoon winds that try to reach the Thar desert. The beautiful hill station of Mount Abu is nestled amidst these ranges.<br>
        
        One of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the mountain range of Western Ghats is about 1600 m long and passes through Gujarat and Kanyakumari. Known as the Sahyadri mountains, it comprises the ranges of Nilgiris (known for its tea plantations) and Anaimalai (one of the highest peaks in Kerala).<br>
        
        Comparatively lower in altitude than the Western Ghats, the Eastern Ghats run parallel to the Bay of Bengal, through the states of West Bengal, Odisha, andhra-pradesh and Tamil Nadu. These mountains are home to many rivers that contribute to the fertility of the land, like the Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi and Kaveri. These ghats also boast many prominent pilgrim spots.   </p>
