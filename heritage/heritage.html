        <p> A land resounding with the riches and glories of opulent dynasties, powerful rulers, flourishing civilisations and profound history, India has a splendid heritage that is reflected in its architecture, monuments, arts, crafts, cultures and even religions. While formidable forts, ancient temples and grand palaces testify of the grandeur of times gone by, the various museums and galleries scattered across the country act as inventories of India's seamless past. Such is the magnificence of the structures in the country that UNESCO has identified several of them as heritage sites.</p>

                <p class="sectionTag">Taj Mahal</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag">Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, the creator of the Taj Mahal, said that the beauty of the monument made “the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes”. It has also been described as a “teardrop on the cheek of eternity” by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Every year, thousands of tourists from around the world make a beeline for this breathtakingly ethereal marble monument, considerd by many as the most beautiful building constructed by man. The monument was built as a memorial by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his deceased wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the seven wonders of the world and is a monument of pride for not just Agra but also India.<br>
                    It is also widely believed that emperor Shah Jahan invited artisans from Italy and Persia to work on this marble monument. It is said that Ustad Ahmad Lahori was the chief of the project while Ustad Isa Afandi made the site plan. The calligraphic work has been credited to Amanat Ali Khan Shirazi. A fascinating aspect of this structure is that it looks the same from all four sides, except the one that faces River Yamuna. This side is said to have been especially embellished to serve as the main entrance for the emperor. Shah Jahan would approach the Taj Mahal from the river, aboard a barge, while the entrance used by tourists today served, at the time, as an entryway for soldiers and common people. There are intricate inscriptions on all four entrances, while marble carvings and pietra dura mosaics adorn the walls. Lapis-lazuli, cornelian, mother of pearl, agate and emerald are some of the precious gems and stones that were once used in its design. It is said that work on its construction began in 1631. Legend has it that it took 20 years to complete this architectural marvel!

                <p class="sectionTag">Red Fort</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag">Lying at the heart of Delhi, the majestic Red Fort, made of fine red sandstone, stands as a testament to the architectural legacy of the Mughals. One of the most beautiful monuments in the world, this UNESCO World Heritage Site, famous as qila-e-mubaraq, is replete with palaces, pavilions and mosques.<br>
                    Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as the palace fort of his capital Shahjahanabad, Red Fort is famous for its massive enclosing walls. The architecture of the fort reflects a seamless fusion of Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu styles. The major attractions are the Diwan-i-khas, also known as the Shah Mahal, the Diwan-i-aam or the Hall of Public Audience and the Rang Mahal (a part of the harem), also known as Imtiyaz Mahal. The other monuments here are the Naubat Khana (Drum House), where royal musicians played and announced the arrival of royal family members; the hammam (royal bath), and the Muthamman Burj, or Musaman Burj (a tower where the emperor would show himself to his subjects). Once the power of the Mughals weakend, the fort was plundered by the Persians, led by Nadir Shah, in 1739. The invaders took away much of the fort's treasures, including the opulent Peacock Throne, which Shah Jahan had crafted out of gold and gemstones (including the precious Kohinoor diamond).<br>
                     Besides the monuments, a major draw for tourists today is Son et Lumiere, a sound and light show, which is held every evening. The enchanting one-hour long show traces the Mughal empire's history in India and offers a glimpse of their glorious past as well as the eventful phases that led to their downfall. The narration has been recorded by legendary actor Amitabh Bachchan, which makes the show absolutely engaging.
                     The fort's construction was completed over a span of ten years (1638-48). It once overlooked the Yamuna river, which has shrunken away over the course of time. Historians also suggest that a tree-lined waterway, which was called nahr-i-bihisht or river of paradise, ran out of the fort and its water was sourced from River Yamuna.

                <p class="sectionTag">Gateway Of India</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag">The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay,
                    India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo
                    Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.
    
                    Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911.
                    The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was
                    sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later
                    used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay. It served
                    to allow entry and access to India.
    
                    The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati
                    Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as
                    the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city’s top tourist attraction.

                <p class="sectionSubTag">Located about 107 km from Aurangabad, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ajanta Caves are a famous cluster of 32 Buddhist caves. The rock-hewn caves at Ajanta are either chaityas (shrine), chapels or prayer halls, or viharas (monasteries) or residential cells.

                    Caves 9 and 10 are chaityas, which contain the earliest known remnants of paintings in India. Caves 19, 26 and 29 are chaityas of the Mahayana period and all the other caves are viharas. Ajanta displays the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art from the Kushana period; the Sarnath school of art from the Gupta period; and the Amaravati school of art from the late Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods. 
                    
                    The Ajanta paintings recount the life of Lord Buddha, including his previous earthly experiences and the Jataka tales. The caves are divided into two chronological phases, the early Buddhist caves (2nd century BCE to 1st century CE) and the Mahayana caves (5th century CE). 
                    
                    Since Ajanta is located on the ancient trade route of Dakshinapatha, the early phase of Ajanta was funded mostly by traders. The second phase received patronage from the Vakatakas. Stories of these donors are inscribed and painted. The narrative murals about Lord Buddha, Avadana stories of Bodhisattva, Jataka stories and panels based on Mahayana themes from Vipulya Sutras are extremely interesting. The monasteries were in operation till 8th century CE but were lost and forgotten till 1819.

                <p class="sectionSubTag">This beautiful temple dedicated to Goddess Padmavati is situated in Tiruchanur, a small town near Tirupati. Also called as Alamelumangapuram, the temple is believed to be very significant for Hindus as Goddess Padmavati is said to be very benevolent and readily forgives her devotees. The temple has an inscription that expounds on the history of the place. According to it, there was a temple dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara in Tiruchanur originally. Since it was quite cramped, it was difficult for priests to perform rituals and all activity was moved to another premise. Eventually, only two important rituals were performed at the original site. Over time, even this stopped and the place faded into insignificance. However, in the 12th century, it again came into the limelight when the Yadava kings built the Shri Krishna Balaram Temple here. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the deity of Sundara Varadaraja was installed and a temple was built for Goddess Padmavati. Legend has it that the goddess was born in a lotus pond that is now a tank within the temple.

                    Goddess Padmavati is said to be the consort of Lord Venkateshwara, the presiding deity of Tirupati. The idol in the temple features the goddess sitting in padmasana posture and holding two lotuses. Other idols that are housed are those of Lord Krishna, Lord Balram, Sundararaja Swami and Surya-narayana Swami. A flag that has been hoisted from the temple bears the image of an elephant, which is said to be the carrier of the goddess. The best time to visit the temple is during Navratri (a holy nine-day festival), Dussehra and Theppotsavam (boat festival) and during the month of Kartheeka, when the Lord is said to send gifts to Goddess Padmavati.

                <p class="sectionSubTag">Jaipur’s most iconic building, the pink Hawa Mahal, stands royally in the bustling Johari Bazaar. With a fine honeycomb of latticed windows, the five-storeyed monument lives to its name, which means the palace of wind. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, Hawa Mahal was primarily constructed as a summer retreat for the royal household and was also used by the royal ladies to enjoy the lively vibes of Johari Bazaar through the white framed windows, while they themselves stayed hidden from the people on the street. Interestingly, the arrangement of the windows is said to resemble the crown of Lord Krishna. Inside, there is a museum that houses Rajasthani miniature art and outside is a hub of stalls selling handmade jewellery, leather-crafted home decor items and the region’s famous silver jewellery.

                <p class="sectionSubTag">Believed to be one of the oldest and most revered temples of Chennai, Kapaleeswarar Temple is a shrine of Lord Shiva. In the temple, the wife of Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati is worshipped in the incarnation of Goddess Karpagambal. She is believed to be the 'Goddess of the Wish-Yielding Tree'.  As a ritual of Friday worship, Goddess Karpagambal is offered a garland made of gold coins called kaasu mala.
                    A classic example of Dravidian style of architecture, the best known feature of the temple is 37-m-high gopuram (gateway). On entering the temple, one is greeted with the view of a sculpture of a holy saint named Gnanasambandar. There are beautiful bronze carvings of the 63 Shaivate saints and one of the oldest trees of Chennai, Punnai tree, is in the courtyard of the temple.
                    
                    The temple has a number of interesting features, including vahanas (Sanskrit word for vehicles), bull, adhikaranandi, elephant, bandicoot, peacock, goat, and parrot, along with a golden chariot. 
                    
                     A 10-day long procession is carried out every year during the Aruvathumoovar festival in March-April, which sees hundreds of footfalls.
